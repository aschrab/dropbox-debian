This script does a basic conversion of the Ubuntu package provided by Dropbox
to allow it to be installed on a Debian system.

The package contents are not altered, only the control information.  It is
completely possible that this will not work for future versions of the package.
I have only tested it on the nautilus-dropbox_0.6.9_amd64.deb package, but it
should work on the i386 package as well.

I have successfully installed the resulting package on both Debian testing and
Linux Mint Debian Edition.
